# PRODIGY_DS_02
This is the second task of Prodigy infotech on "Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis"<br>
#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Used Car Prices<br>
#Overview<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding datasets, identifying patterns, and informing subsequent analyses. This project focuses on performing EDA on a used car dataset to explore factors influencing car prices.<br>

#Project Objectives<br>
Understand the Dataset: Analyze the dataset to grasp its structure and content.<br>
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.<br>
Feature Engineering: Create new features to improve the analysis.<br>
Data Transformation: Normalize and transform data columns as needed.<br>
Visualization: Use various visualizations for Univariate, Bi-Variate, and Multivariate Analysis.<br>

#Data Analysis Process<br>
Initial Data Exploration<br>

#Investigated the basic structure of the dataset.<br>
Dropped irrelevant columns that did not contribute to the analysis.<br>

#Feature Engineering<br>

Added columns that provided additional insights into car prices.<br>

#Data Transformation<br>

Normalized columns to standardize the data.<br>
#Visualization
<div>
Applied different types of visualizations to uncover insights:
Univariate Analysis: Examined individual features.
Bi-Variate Analysis: Investigated relationships between pairs of features.
Multivariate Analysis: Explored interactions among multiple features.

#Key Insights
Car Seating Capacity: 2-seat cars tend to be priced higher due to customer preference.
Car Age: Car prices decrease as the car's age increases.
Ownership: First-owner cars generally command higher prices compared to second or third owners.
Fuel Type: Increased fuel prices have shifted customer preference towards electric vehicles.
Transmission Type: Automatic transmission vehicles are preferred over manual ones for their ease of use.
