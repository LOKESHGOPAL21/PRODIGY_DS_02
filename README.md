# PRODIGY_DS_02
This is the second task of Prodigy infotech on "Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis"
#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Used Car Prices
#Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding datasets, identifying patterns, and informing subsequent analyses. This project focuses on performing EDA on a used car dataset to explore factors influencing car prices.

#Project Objectives
Understand the Dataset: Analyze the dataset to grasp its structure and content.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Create new features to improve the analysis.
Data Transformation: Normalize and transform data columns as needed.
Visualization: Use various visualizations for Univariate, Bi-Variate, and Multivariate Analysis.
Data Analysis Process
Initial Data Exploration

#Investigated the basic structure of the dataset.
Dropped irrelevant columns that did not contribute to the analysis.
Feature Engineering

Added columns that provided additional insights into car prices.
Data Transformation

Normalized columns to standardize the data.
#Visualization

Applied different types of visualizations to uncover insights:
Univariate Analysis: Examined individual features.
Bi-Variate Analysis: Investigated relationships between pairs of features.
Multivariate Analysis: Explored interactions among multiple features.

#Key Insights
Car Seating Capacity: 2-seat cars tend to be priced higher due to customer preference.
Car Age: Car prices decrease as the car's age increases.
Ownership: First-owner cars generally command higher prices compared to second or third owners.
Fuel Type: Increased fuel prices have shifted customer preference towards electric vehicles.
Transmission Type: Automatic transmission vehicles are preferred over manual ones for their ease of use.
